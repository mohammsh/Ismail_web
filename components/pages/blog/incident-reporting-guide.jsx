      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How AI is Enhancing Cybersecurity</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Threat Detection:</strong> AI can analyze vast amounts of data in real time to detect anomalies that
          may indicate a cyberattack.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI algorithms can predict potential vulnerabilities and recommend
          proactive measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Responses:</strong> AI can automate responses to common threats, such as blocking malicious
          IPs or quarantining infected files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While AI brings many benefits, it also raises concerns about adversarial AI and ethical considerations. However,
        its potential to revolutionize cybersecurity cannot be understated.
